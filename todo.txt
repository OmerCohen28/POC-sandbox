Finished hooking CreateFileA.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for all the notes, try to structure the program into classes and make it start looking like an actual project, espacially after POC is done
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Look at MSDN and loook for all:
delete file functions,
open file functions,
create file functions,
write file functions.

than:
look at socket functions (send,recv) and hook them as well

POC IS OVER!!

after:
let the program feel as if it actually works, if it tried to read a file allow it, 
if it tries to edit a file - clone it, let the program edit it, delete it.
if it tried to send something emulate as if it did.
if it tried to recv something send a buffer of nothing.
